  - question: Which deep learning technique is used to get text similarity?
    answers:
      text: Sentence Embedding
      modifiers:
        - IC
  - question: Which of the following is used to predict text similarity between text it has not seen in the training phase?
    answers:
      - 0
    options:
      - Deep Learning
      - Machine Learning
    explanation:
      - Using sentence embedding deep learning technique the model can predict text similarity, which might not be possible with regular machine learning
